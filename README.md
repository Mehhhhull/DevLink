# DevLink

DevLink is a work-in-progress web app focused on **hackathon-driven collaboration**.

The goal is simple:  
help students and builders **find the right people, ideas, and guidance** for hackathons — faster and with less chaos than Discord, WhatsApp, or random LinkedIn posts.

## What DevLink is (MVP scope)
- A platform for hackathon enthusiasts to connect and collaborate
- Team / teammate discovery based on relevant constraints (skills, availability, preferences)
- Idea discovery and validation (human + AI assisted)
- Community-driven learning and mentorship (experimental)

> This project is under active development. Features may change, evolve, or be removed as the product gets validated.

## Why this exists
Hackathons are high-pressure, short-time events.  
Finding teammates, solid ideas, and quick feedback wastes too much time.

DevLink is an attempt to reduce that friction.

## Status
🚧 **Early development / MVP phase**  
Expect breaking changes, rough edges, and rapid iteration.

## Tech Stack (tentative)
- Frontend: TBD
- Backend: TBD
- Database: TBD
- AI: Experimental (idea analysis & discovery)
